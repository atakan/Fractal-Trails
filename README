This is a collection of programs to create and analyze trails of random
walk (in 1D or 3D, optionally with bias and/or bounds), presented as a
time series. The analysis is done by estimating the fractal dimension
of the trails and yields the timescales of correlations as well as
their strength.

I used the techniques for creating and analyzing random walk trails
in a paper that is available in the doc/ directory. This paper has
the formulae for estimating the fractal dimension. The code in this
repository is a clean-up/rewrite of the code used for that paper. So
far, only the code for creating trails is here (trail_maker.py);
I will clean up and upload the analysis code soon.

trail_maker.py uses NumPy and argparse.
