This is a collection of programs to create and analyze trails of random
walk (in 1D or 3D, optionally with bias and/or bounds), presented as a
time series. The analysis is done by estimating the fractal dimension
of the trails and yields the timescales of correlations as well as
their strength.

I used the techniques for creating and analyzing random walk trails
in a paper that is available in the `doc/` directory. This paper has
the formulae for estimating the fractal dimension. The code in this
repository is a clean-up/rewrite of the code used for that paper. 

`trail_maker.py` uses [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) and
[argparse](http://code.google.com/p/argparse/).

`trail_analyzer` uses [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/),
[argparse](http://code.google.com/p/argparse/),
[Cython](http://cython.org/) and [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).
To use it, first create `trail_length_calc.so` by running

`python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
